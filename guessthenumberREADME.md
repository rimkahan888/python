# Guess The Number (Dummy Script)

This is a simple placeholder Python game where the player *pretends* to guess a number.
Itâ€™s deliberately incomplete and meant for practicing Git workflows by committing code in stages.

## Features
- Generates a random number (placeholder logic)
- Simulates user guesses
- Checks guesses (placeholder messages)
- Includes dummy error handling and validation
- Explanations for each core function

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repository:

Run the script from the terminal:

## Notes

This script is intentionally incomplete and non-functional.
It exists only for learning Git commands and simulating a feature-by-feature commit process.
